Fake Product Identification Smart Contract
Overview
This project is a decentralized application (dApp) implemented in the Move programming language and deployed on the Aptos blockchain. The primary purpose of this smart contract is to manage the verification of product authenticity, enabling users to identify counterfeit products. It includes functionality for managing sellers, products, and tracking the lifecycle of products from manufacturing to the end consumer.

Features
Seller Management: Add and manage sellers with attributes like name, brand, code, contact number, manager, and address.
Product Management: Add and manage products with attributes like name, serial number, brand, price, and status.
Product Lifecycle Tracking: Track the movement of products from the manufacturer to sellers, and then to consumers.
Product Verification: Allows consumers to verify the authenticity of a product using its serial number.
Purchase History: Retrieve a consumerâ€™s purchase history, including product serial numbers, seller codes, and manufacturer codes.
Modules
